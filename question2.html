<h1>Question 2:</h1>
<p>
    Compare CLI vs. GUI clients for working with Git
</p>

<br>



<h1>Answer:</h1>

<h2>CLI clients at a glance</h2>>

<h3>Advantages of commandline clients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Very powerful and flexible</li>
    <li>Cross-platform: works on all systems with no adjusting period</li>
    <li>Learn once: cnce learnt, you don't have to learn new commands / procedures when you go another system</li>
    <li>Can configure all parts of the program</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages of commandline clients</h3>

<br>

<h2>GUI clients at a glance</h2>>

<h3>Advantages of GUI clients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid having to learn off commands</li>
    <li>Avoid having to type; point-and-click interface</li>
    <li>Options are clearly and easily presented</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages of GUI clients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>GUI clients differ from system to system and require an adjusting period</li>
    <li>Not as powerful or flexible as their CLI counterparts</li>
    <li>Not all options may be available and may not be able to configure all parts of the Git program</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Comparative thoughts....</h2>
I believe the choice between the two client types comes down to three factors:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Cross-platform use:</strong> if the developer is only working on one system then a GUI client is a very good choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Commandline comfortability:</strong> if the developer is not happy with working from the terminal
        then a GUI would be strongly favoured.</li>
    <li><strong>Variance of commands:</strong> GUI's are not as flexible and tend not to have all of the options available to
        the user; if the developer does not vary from the normal Git commands / uses too much then a GUI might be a better choice.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Personally, I prefer to work from the terminal; I have years of experience in a CLI environment, I am a very capable
    typist and I regularly work on different (operating) systems so cross-platform advantages appeal to me.
