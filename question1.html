<h2>1 &dash; The versioning system .... </h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
    When working in software development, with files which change frequently, there are a number of advantages to having
    a version control system:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enables different versions of the same file to exist</li>
    <li>Allows the developer to easily roll back changes</li>
    <li>Removes the need to rename the different versions of the same file</li>
</ul>

<h2>2 &dash; Concurrent editing by multiple users .... </h2>
<p>
    When working in software development, where teams of developers can be working on the same files, there are a number
    of advantages to allowing concurrent editing using <em>diff's</em>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enables multiple developers to work on the same file(s)</li>
    <li>Diff's allows the changes by each developer to be added and logged</li>
    <li>Diff's only update the parts of the files which have changed</li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensures small data is transferred meaning:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transfers are small &dash; thus, traffic on the network is reduced, an important consideration
                        in businesses </li>
                    <li>Small transfers are fast &dash; ensuring there is little to no <em>down time</em> for developers
                        working on the files</li>
                    <li>The small Fast transfers ensure synchronizations are made quickly, leading to all
                        developers having quick access to the latest files</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
